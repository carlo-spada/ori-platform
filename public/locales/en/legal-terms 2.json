Usage Limits and Fair Use</h2>\n<p>Certain features may be subject to usage limits (for example, the maximum number of personalized job-opening batches or AI-generated documents per month). The applicable limits for your plan are described in the Service and may be updated or adjusted for system integrity, fairness, or abuse prevention.</p>\n<p>You agree not to circumvent or attempt to circumvent any usage limits (e.g., by creating multiple accounts to gain additional free usage).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"acceptable-use\">7.

Third-Party Services and Links</h2>\n<p>The Service may integrate with or link to third-party websites, services, or tools (for example, identity providers, job boards, or communication platforms).

Disclaimers</h2>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided \"as is\" and \"as available\", without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>\n<p>We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from harmful components, or that any results or outcomes from using the Service will meet your expectations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"limitation-of-liability\">15. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall Ori, its affiliates, directors, employees, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms will not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you have paid to us for the Service in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) one hundred (100) euros (€100).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"indemnification\">16.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>These Terms, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or the Service, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of <strong>Italy</strong> and applicable <strong>European Union law</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>\n<p>Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the <strong>courts of Padova, Italy</strong>, unless mandatory law provides otherwise. You and Ori agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>\n<p>Before initiating formal legal proceedings, the parties will attempt to resolve the dispute amicably by good-faith negotiation for at least thirty (30) days, unless urgent injunctive relief is required.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"changes\">18. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>\n<p>We may modify or discontinue parts of the Service from time to time in order to improve, update, or comply with legal requirements. Where a change has a material impact on your use of the Service, we will provide reasonable advance notice where practicable.</p>\n<p>We may also update these Terms from time to time. The \"Last updated\" date at the top of the Terms will indicate when changes were made. Where changes are material, we will provide additional notice (for example, in-app notice or email). If you continue to use the Service after the effective date of the updated Terms, you will be deemed to have accepted them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">19. Miscellaneous</h2>\n<p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.</p>\n<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations under them without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact\">20.
