**Type:** Open-ended (required)
**Character limit:** 500

**Prompt:** *Please describe in your own words. The more specific, the better!*

**Analysis Note:** This is a **critical pain point discovery question**. Code responses for themes (time waste, irrelevance, ghosting, overwhelm, etc.). Capture exact language for marketing copy.

**Why this question:** Open-ended format captures authentic user language and uncovers unexpected pain points. [Source: UserGuiding 2025, Customer Pain Points Guide]

---

#### Q3. How would you describe your ideal job search experience? What would make it feel easy and effective?

**Type:** Open-ended (required)
**Character limit:** 500

**Prompt:** *Dream big! What would the perfect job search tool do for you?*

**Analysis Note:** Reveals Jobs-to-be-Done (functional, emotional, social). Look for themes around time-saving, confidence, control, personalization.

---

### Section 2: Messaging & Value Proposition Testing (5 questions)

**Purpose:** Test force-based messaging resonance (Contrast/Stability/Bridge)

#### Q4. We're testing different ways to describe Ori. Please read the following statement:

**Then ask:**

**How clear is this message to you?**

**Type:** Likert scale (5-point)
**Required:** Yes

- [ ] Very unclear
- [ ] Somewhat unclear
- [ ] Neutral
- [ ] Somewhat clear
- [ ] Very clear

**Analysis Note:** Clarity benchmark: 70%+ selecting "Somewhat clear" or "Very clear" = strong messaging.

**Type:** Open-ended (required)

### Template 4: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Analysis

**Step 1: Collect Data**

For each response, you have 4 price points:
- Q9: Too Expensive (TE)
- Q10: Too Cheap (TC)
- Q11: Expensive (E)
- Q12: Bargain (B)

**Step 2: Create Cumulative Frequency Charts**

Create a spreadsheet with price points ($0-$50 in $1 increments):

| Price | Too Cheap | Not Bargain | Not Expensive | Too Expensive |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| $1 | % respondents who said TC ≥ $1 | % who said B < $1 | % who said E < $1 | % who said TE ≥ $1 |
| $2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | | | | |

**Step 3: Plot Intersections**

- **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** Where "Too Cheap" crosses "Too Expensive"
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP):** Where "Expensive" crosses "Bargain"
- **Acceptable Price Range:** Between OPP and IPP

**Step 4: Analyze $5/month Target**

```
Is $5 within the acceptable range? [YES / NO]

What % said $5 is:
- Too expensive: ___%
- Too cheap: ___%
- Good value (bargain): ___%
- Getting expensive: ___%

Recommended action:
[ ] Keep $5/month
[ ] Test lower price ($____)
[ ] Test higher price ($____)
[ ] Offer tiered pricing
```

**Tools:** Use Excel/Google Sheets with line chart, or tools like [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) which have built-in Van Westendorp analysis.

## Best Practices & Methodology

### Survey Design Principles (2025 Standards)

#### 1. **Optimal Survey Length**
- **Target:** 8-10 minutes (15 questions)
- **Why:** Surveys >12 minutes see significant drop-off, especially on mobile
- **Source:** [Qualtrics 2025, Survey Methodology Best Practices]

**This survey:** 15 questions = ~8-10 minutes ✅

---

#### 2. **Question Order Strategy**
- **Start with easy, engaging questions** (Q1 - job search recency)
- **Build to more thoughtful questions** (Q2-Q8 - pain points and messaging)
- **End with sensitive/demographic questions** (Q15 - optional)
- **Source:** [NCBIst 2025, Questionnaire Design & Validation]

**This survey:** Follows recommended flow ✅

---

#### 3. **Mix of Question Types**
- **Quantitative (multiple choice, Likert, ranking):** Enable statistical analysis
- **Qualitative (open-ended):** Capture authentic language and unexpected insights
- **Optimal ratio:** 60% quantitative, 40% qualitative

**This survey:** 9 quantitative, 6 qualitative = 60/40 split ✅

**Source:** [SoundRocket 2025, Questionnaire Design Best Practices]

---

#### 4. **Anti-Hallucination Protocol**
- **Use specific, concrete questions** rather than vague prompts
- **Ask for examples** when possible
- **Avoid leading questions** that suggest desired answers

**Example of good vs. bad:**
- ❌ Bad: "Don't you think job search is frustrating?"
- ✅ Good: "What was the biggest frustration you experienced during your job search?"

**This survey:** Uses neutral, specific questions ✅

---

#### 5. **Privacy & Anonymity**
- **Clearly state privacy policy** in introduction
- **Make demographic questions optional** to increase comfort
- **Never require identifying information** unless necessary for follow-up

**This survey:** Anonymous, optional demographics ✅

**Source:** [HubSpot 2025, Survey Design Best Practices]

### Methodology References

#### **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (Q9-Q12)**

**What it is:** A pricing research methodology that identifies optimal price ranges by asking four key questions about price perception.

**Why we use it:** Industry standard for early-stage pricing validation. Used by Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.

**How it works:**
1. Respondents give 4 price points (too cheap, bargain, expensive, too expensive)
2. Plot cumulative frequencies
3. Intersections reveal optimal pricing zones

**Limitations:**
- Assumes rational price sensitivity (may not capture emotional pricing)
- Doesn't account for competitive context
- Best for directional guidance, not absolute truth

**Source:** [SurveyMonkey 2025, Van Westendorp Guide] [Hotjar 2025, Van Westendorp Template]

---

#### **Jobs-to-be-Done Framework (Q2, Q3, Q8)**

**What it is:** A framework for understanding the underlying "job" customers are trying to accomplish, beyond surface-level features.

**Why we use it:** Reveals true customer motivations (functional, emotional, social jobs) that inform product development and messaging.

**How it works:**
1. Ask about problems, ideal outcomes, and goals
2. Extract job statements in "I want to ______" format
3. Categorize as functional, emotional, or social jobs
4. Prioritize jobs by frequency and intensity

**Application for Ori:**
- Functional: "Find relevant job matches quickly"
- Emotional: "Feel confident I'm not missing opportunities"
- Social: "Appear organized and proactive to recruiters"

#### **Message Testing Methodology (Q4-Q7)**

**What it is:** Systematic testing of value proposition messaging for clarity, relevance, and comprehension.

**Why we use it:** Validates that your marketing message is understood and resonates with target audience.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Clarity:** Can users understand the message?
- **Relevance:** Does it matter to them?
- **Comprehension:** Can they explain it back accurately?
- **Preference:** Which frame resonates most?

**Benchmarks (2025):**
- Clarity: 70%+ "clear" ratings = strong message
- Relevance: 65%+ "relevant" ratings = product-market fit signal
- Comprehension: 70%+ accurate recall = message working

---

#### **Pain Point Discovery (Q2, Q8)**

**What it is:** Open-ended questions designed to uncover authentic customer frustrations and unmet needs.

**Why we use it:** Reveals real language customers use (for marketing) and validates problem-solution fit.

**Best Practices:**
- Ask for specific examples, not general opinions
- Use "biggest frustration" not "what frustrates you" (forces prioritization)
- Avoid suggesting pain points in the question itself
- Capture verbatim quotes for marketing copy

**Analysis Approach:**
- Read all responses twice before coding
- Create emergent categories (don't force predetermined themes)
- Count frequency to prioritize
- Extract exact quotes for authentic messaging

- **Avoid:** Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends

**Follow-up cadence:**

- **Day 3:** Reminder #1 (non-responders only)
   - Subject: "Friendly reminder: Ori survey (8 mins)"
- **Day 7:** Final reminder (non-responders only)
   - Subject: "Last chance: Share your Ori feedback"

**Response tracking:**
- Target: 40-60 responses (40-60% response rate)
- If <30% by Day 5, consider incentive boost or messaging tweak
