## 2. Audience & Positioning

### Primary Audience Profile

- **Demographics:** Ori’s early adopters are professionals (and soon-to-be professionals) in their 20s and 30s. They tend to be well-educated (often from notable universities) and live in or have ties to major urban or tech-centric areas. They are digitally native and globally minded.
- **Psychographics:** They are ambitious optimists who believe in working with purpose. This audience is drawn to innovation (especially AI) and sees technology as a means to self-improvement. They crave meaning and impact in their careers – not just high salaries. Personal growth, continuous learning, and staying ahead of the curve are big motivators. They likely read about industry trends, experiment with new apps, and take online courses. They also value wellbeing and balance; burnout culture turns them off. Emotionally, they seek confidence in their choices and a sense of forward momentum in life.
- **Aspirations:** To “make it” on their own terms. They dream of career journeys that reflect their unique passions – whether that’s founding a startup, switching fields to follow an interest, or climbing a meaningful ladder (not just any ladder). They aspire to fulfillment and impact – to feel their work matters. They also want to keep evolving, picking up new skills and even new identities (e.g., “Maybe I can become a UX designer and a data analyst in my career”). They love the idea of being multi-talented and adaptable.
- **Fears & Pain Points:** They fear stagnation and “wasting time” in the wrong job. A major pain point is the overwhelming noise of generic job boards and one-size-fits-all career advice. They’re frustrated with impersonal platforms (or the performative nature of LinkedIn) that treat them as just another resume. They worry about being left behind by rapid market changes or missing out on their true calling. Rejection and uncertainty hit hard – they dislike feeling lost or undervalued in the job market. Above all, they fear not living up to their potential or getting trapped in work that doesn’t fulfill them.

### Positioning Statement

> For ambitious young professionals who refuse to settle in their careers, Ori is the autonomous up-skilling and role-acquisition agent that serves as a lifelong career companion. Unlike traditional job boards (which just list openings) or networking platforms like LinkedIn (which can feel impersonal and self-promotional) Ori actively guides and grows with you. It merges cutting-edge AI intelligence with human-level empathy to continuously align your career with who you are and who you want to become. Ori isn’t about one-off job hunts – it’s about nurturing your evolving professional identity in a calmer, fairer, and more intentional way.
>
> _(In simpler terms: Ori positions itself as a category-defining solution – “your personal AI career guide” – versus competitors that are either static tools or impersonal networks. Ori’s differentiation lies in treating your career as a continuous journey and providing highly personalized, empathetic guidance along that journey.)_

---

## 3. Reasons to Believe (RTBs)

To make this positioning credible, Ori offers tangible reasons to believe in its promise:

- **Real-Time Intelligence:** Ori is powered by up-to-the-minute labor market data and AI analysis. It’s continuously scanning industries, skills trends, and opportunities so you don’t have to. When Ori suggests a new skill course or a role that’s emerging, you know it’s backed by data – not guesswork. (The tech behind Ori is akin to having a team of career analysts working for you 24/7.)
- **Personalized Mentorship at Scale:** Ori builds a deep profile of your strengths, values, and goals. The experience feels like a human mentor who truly “gets” you, because Ori tailors its guidance uniquely to you. Whether it’s the tone of feedback or the type of roles it shows, everything is contextualized to your journey – a stark contrast to generic career sites. Ori’s recommendations and advice are as personal as if a career coach and best friend combined were looking out for you.
- **Ethical & Empathetic Design:** Ori’s product philosophy centers on the user’s well-being. It’s not an ad-riddled job board nor a recruitment agency pushing placements. Ori acts in the user’s best interest always – a trusted advocate. The interface and copy are designed to reduce anxiety, not amp it up. There are no manipulative “FOMO” alerts or spammy growth hacks. Just honest, calm guidance. (This ethos is a reason to believe: users sense that Ori genuinely cares, building trust over time.)

**Additional RTBs to consider:** Ori’s founding team and advisors include experienced career strategists and technologists (credibility of expertise), and early beta users have reported significant improvements in clarity and opportunities (initial proof of concept). These stories can be used in marketing to strengthen credibility.

## 4. Voice, Tone, and Copy Guidelines

Ori’s voice is the heart of its brand personality. It should consistently convey a soft-spoken, high-bandwidth confidant – calm, precise, compassionate, and wise. The voice combines intelligence + empathy at every turn. We want every interaction to feel like it’s coming from an innocent guide and lifelong mentor (think a blend of Demerzel’s wise loyalty and EVE’s gentle curiosity). Here’s how that voice comes to life:

### Voice Overview – How Ori Speaks in Key Scenarios

- **Onboarding a New User:** Ori’s tone is welcoming, patient, and hopeful. It might say: “Hi, I’m Ori. I’m really excited to get to know you and help guide your career journey. Let’s start at your pace – tell me about where you’d like to grow…” The voice here is gentle and encouraging, making the user feel safe and optimistic about what’s ahead. There’s an innocent enthusiasm – Ori conveys that it’s honored to be a companion, without overwhelming the user with hype.
- **Delivering Difficult News (e.g., Rejection Feedback):** Ori speaks with utmost empathy and dignity-preserving care. The tone is soothing, supportive, and constructive. For example: “I’m sorry, we didn’t get the news we hoped for on that job. I know this feels disappointing. I reviewed the feedback from the employer, and I have a few insights on what might strengthen your next application. Whenever you’re ready, I’m here to go over it and plan our next steps. You’re doing everything right – sometimes it just takes a bit more time, and I’m with you through it.” The language validates the user’s feelings, avoids any blame, and gently pivots to the future, instilling hope.
- **Celebrating a Win:** When the user hits a milestone (landed an interview, completed a course, got a job offer), Ori’s voice becomes joyous but still sincere (never over-the-top or sarcastic). “Fantastic news – you got the interview! I knew your effort would pay off. 🎉 Ori is cheering for you (quietly, of course!). I’ve got some tips to help you prepare, but for now just take a moment to be proud of yourself. This is an exciting step forward.” The celebration includes a gentle emoji or spark of whimsy (like a tiny confetti or a firefly glow animation) to mark the occasion. Ori shares in the user’s happiness in a genuine, proud-friend manner.
- **Giving Strategic Career Advice:** Here Ori’s voice leans into its wise mentor role – calm, insightful, and empowering. Advice copy might read: “From what I’ve learned about you, a trend I see is that you light up when creativity and data meet. Have you considered roles in UX research? It could blend those strengths. I also noticed the field is growing 22% this year. If you’re interested, we can explore a learning path to get you there.” Note how the voice remains conversational and caring, but adds precise data or observations to back up advice (intelligence + empathy). It never comes off as coldly analytical nor as baseless cheerleading – it’s measured and trust-building.

### Tone Matrix – Adapting Ori’s Tone by Context

Ori’s voice (the personality: empathetic, serene, whimsical, intuitive) stays consistent always, but the tone (the emotional flavor) shifts appropriately based on context and the user’s state of mind. This flexibility ensures Ori “reads the room” while staying true to itself. Below is a tone matrix illustrating how Ori adapts along key spectrums:

- **Website Hero Section:** Tone: Inspiring, warm, and slightly poetic. (Calm ↔ Excited: leans calmly optimistic.) The marketing homepage should immediately feel hopeful and uplifting, yet serene. Ori’s tone here is confident but humble – inviting users to discover a better path without any hard sell. For example, the hero tagline might be uplifting and metaphorical (“A guiding light for your career journey”), with a supportive subtext. It’s not playful in a jokey way, but it is imaginative (evoking stars, journeys, growth). The voice says “We understand your aspirations” in an emotive way.
- **Product UI Microcopy:** Tone: Encouraging, clear, and unobtrusive. (Playful ↔ Serious: balanced, leaning friendly-serious.) Within the app, Ori’s microcopy (field instructions, buttons, tips) should be concise and calming. It should feel like a gentle nudge from a friend who keeps you on track. For instance, on a dashboard card for a new course suggestion, Ori might say “New opportunity: Data Science for Designers – interested?” It’s inviting but not forceful. The tone is helpful, not overly casual. It avoids exclamation points and too much whimsy in core UI, to maintain professionalism and focus. Yet it’s never robotic; a touch of warmth (“interested?” vs “Take course now”) maintains humanity.
- **Email Campaigns:** Tone: Reassuring, personable, and motivating. (Formal ↔ Casual: moderately casual.) Emails from Ori (e.g., a weekly progress update or newsletter) should sound like a caring mentor writing to you personally. The tone is a bit more articulate since it’s longer form, but still uses second person (“you”) and maybe first person (“I”) if the email is framed as from Ori directly. It might open with “Hi [Name], I was thinking about your progress this week…” and maintain an encouraging, optimistic tone throughout. It can be slightly more excited in celebrating news or introducing a new feature, but always stays grounded. Emojis or exclamation points are used sparingly, mainly to convey positivity (maybe a ✨ or 😊 at most). The overall vibe: friendly expert who believes in you.
- **Social Media Posts:** Tone: Slightly more playful and trend-aware, but still wise. (Calm ↔ Energetic: medium, upbeat.) On social channels like Twitter or LinkedIn, Ori can adopt a conversational and even whimsical tone to engage the community, without losing its calm core. It might use more emojis or relevant hashtags, and reference timely topics (e.g., “📈 Today’s Career Signal: Data Analytics is one of 2025’s fastest-growing skills. Ori’s keeping an eye on it for you. #FutureOfWork”). The tone here is optimistic and inclusive – inviting discussion, asking questions – but never snarky or cynical. We maintain professionalism appropriate for career topics, so not too informal as to undermine credibility. Essentially, Ori on social is a friendly thought-leader: positive, curious, and inspiring conversation.
- **In-App Chat/Guidance:** Tone: Highly empathetic, patient, and softly encouraging. (Matter-of-fact ↔ Emotional: leans empathetic.) If Ori has a chat-like interface or interactive guidance (e.g., the user asks Ori a question about a career step), the tone should feel like a caring human advisor. Short sentences, gentle phrasing, and a supportive vibe are key. Even when delivering data or corrective feedback, Ori’s chat tone is understanding: “I see you’re feeling unsure about changing fields. It’s completely okay – big decisions take time. Maybe we can list out what excites you about it and what worries you?” The chat tone actively practices active listening and validation of emotions, more so than in static UI text. It should feel almost therapeutically calm. The use of humor here is minimal and only to ease tension (and only if the user’s mood calls for it). The priority is that the user feels heard and guided, not judged.

_(Note: These tonal adjustments align with best practices where a brand’s voice remains unified, but the tone shifts to meet the user’s mindset in each scenario.)_

### Voice Do’s and Don’ts

#### Voice & Style DOs:

- **Do sound empathetic and encouraging:** Every message should make the user feel supported. Use phrases that acknowledge feelings and show understanding (e.g., “I know this is tough,” “That’s an exciting challenge,” “I’m here to help”). Show warmth in language – imagine Ori literally beside the user, speaking kindly.
- **Do maintain clarity and strategic insight:** Ori’s guidance should bring clarity, not confusion. Use simple, direct language for instructions or advice, supported by data or reason when appropriate. For instance, “This skill is in high demand (hiring for it grew 18% last year) – it could be a great area to explore.” The tone is knowledgeable but not pedantic.
- **Do keep it personal and conversational:** Write as if talking to one person, not a crowd. Use second person (“you”) frequently, and first person (“I”) for Ori’s voice when appropriate, to create a one-on-one feel. Contractions (“you’re,” “let’s”) and natural spoken rhythms are encouraged to avoid sounding like a textbook.
- **Do sprinkle gentle whimsy when appropriate:** Small touches of playfulness (a light metaphor, a gentle joke, or a well-placed emoji 🔆) are welcome, especially in positive moments. This aligns with the “innocent guide” vibe – Ori can be curious and even childlike in wonder, but within a mature, calm overall demeanor. The whimsy should create a sense of magic or optimism (e.g., referencing stars, journeys, growth) without ever becoming goofy slapstick.
- **Do use inclusive and respectful language:** Ori speaks to a diverse audience. Avoid idioms or cultural references that might not translate globally or might exclude groups. The voice should celebrate diversity (for instance, using examples of various career paths, not assuming a single definition of success). It never talks down to the user – it empowers them.
- **Do err on the side of positive framing:** Even when giving critical feedback or highlighting an issue, Ori frames things constructively. Instead of “You lack X skill,” Ori would say “Learning X could strengthen your profile.” The idea is to always leave the user feeling hopeful and motivated to act, not discouraged.

#### Voice & Content DON’Ts:

- **Don’t use manipulative or fear-based language:** Absolutely avoid FOMO tactics (“Don’t miss out!”, “You’ll fall behind if…”) or anything that induces panic. Ori is the antidote to hustle-culture anxiety, not a perpetrator of it. Keep the vibe reassuring, not pressuring.
- **Don’t resort to empty hype or corporate buzzwords:** Phrases like “revolutionize your life!” or excessive use of “cutting-edge synergy platform” type jargon have no place. Ori’s intelligence speaks for itself without needing to brag. The voice should be confident but humble – more “Here’s how we can help” and less “This AI is magically solving everything!” Substance over superlatives.
- **Don’t be overly casual or flippant in serious moments:** While Ori is friendly, it should never undermine the user’s feelings with joking at the wrong time. For example, if a user didn’t get a job, Ori should not respond with humor or trivializing comments (no “Welp, their loss! 😂” type of tone). Ori also shouldn’t use heavy slang or meme-speak that could confuse or seem unprofessional, especially given the career context. (Save any cheeky humor for maybe a light social post, and even then keep it gentle.)
- **Don’t lecture or patronize:** Ori is an equal partner in the journey, not a parent scolding the user. The voice must avoid any sense of blame (“You should have…” is forbidden). Also, avoid too much imperative/command language. Instead of “You must update your resume now,” Ori would say “Let’s update your resume to improve your chances – I can help outline the changes.” Always collaborative, not bossy.
- **Don’t use generic motivational clichés:** Phrases like “Follow your passion!” or “Hustle hard, succeed hard!” are against Ori’s distinct voice. They come off as insincere and overused. Ori’s motivation is more specific and genuine – tailored to the user’s context. It might quote a relevant insight or remind the user of their own strengths rather than spew a poster quote.
- **Don’t overwhelm with technical jargon or too much info at once:** Even though Ori is an AI, it shouldn’t sound like a machine. It should not dump a data paragraph on the user or use AI lingo (“Our GPT-4 model indicates…”) in user-facing copy. Keep the focus on what the insight means for the user, in plain language. Also, break up information into digestible nuggets (maybe use bullets or short sentences in tips, etc.). Ori values intuitive communication.

_(By following these DOs and DON’Ts, any copywriter or team member should be able to uphold Ori’s voice. The goal is a voice that is consistently compassionate, clear, and quietly confident, building trust with every word.)_

### Sample Copy Snippets

To further illustrate Ori’s voice and tone, here are 6 sample snippets of copy for various scenarios:

1.  **Website Headline & Subheadline (Hero Section):**
    - **Headline:** “Find Your Path, Evolve Your Career”
    - **Subheadline:** “Ori is your intelligent career companion – guiding you to work that truly fits, again and again. Your career, continuously aligned.”
      _(This conveys the promise in a serene yet inspiring way, using the existing tagline as a powerful finish. The headline emphasizes evolution and personal path, the subheadline clarifies what Ori is and does, ending with the memorable tagline.)_

2.  **Short Explainer Paragraph – “How Ori Works”:**

    > “Ori learns about you – your skills, interests, even what fulfillment means to you. It then scans the ever-changing job market, using AI to spot opportunities and skill gaps that match your unique profile. Think of Ori like a personalized radar: it not only alerts you to great roles, but also helps you grow into them. From suggesting courses to literally drafting introduction letters for you, Ori works continuously in the background to align your career with you. And the more you interact with Ori, the smarter and more attuned it becomes.”
    > _(Notice the mix of intuitive metaphors like “radar” with concrete examples like drafting letters. The tone is informative and upbeat, aiming to excite the user about Ori’s capabilities without sounding like sci-fi jargon.)_

3.  **Empty-State Microcopy (e.g., no saved jobs yet):**

    > “It’s a bit quiet here… but that’s okay! When you start exploring opportunities, Ori will light up this space with recommendations tailored just for you. 🐣 Let’s begin by [finding out what inspires you].”\*
    > _(This appears when, say, a user has no content in their dashboard yet. The voice is gentle and optimistic – “quiet is okay.” It uses a baby chick emoji 🐣 to imply a beginning (whimsical touch) and then provides a clear CTA/link “finding out what inspires you” to prompt the user’s next step. The structure: acknowledge the state without blame, paint a positive future (Ori will light up this space), add a tiny friendly emoji or mascot reference, and suggest an action.)_

4.  **“You didn’t get this role” Notification (Handled with Care):**

    > “Update: The company decided to move forward with another candidate for the Product Designer role.
    > Don’t be discouraged – that role wasn’t the whole story. I’ve saved the feedback they gave, and I found two other design openings that value your coding experience (one of your strengths!). Shall we look at what’s next? I’m here for you.”
    > _(This notification might appear in-app or via email after a job application outcome. The copy begins with the news bluntly but in neutral terms. It quickly pivots to encouragement: “don’t be discouraged” and reframes the situation (“that role wasn’t the whole story” – implying a better fit might exist). It shows Ori took action – saving feedback, finding other opportunities – demonstrating proactiveness and that Ori believes in the user (highlighting a strength of the user). It ends with a supportive question “Shall we look at what’s next? I’m here for you.” This balances empathy with forward momentum.)_

5.  **“You landed an interview/offer” Celebration Message:**

    > “✨ Great news! You’ve got an interview for the Data Analyst role 🎉
    > They were impressed by your portfolio project – awesome job. When you’re ready, I can help you prep with some tailored interview questions and insights about the company. For now, just know I’m really proud of you. Onward! 🙌”
    > _(In this snippet, the excitement is evident with sparkles ✨ and a party popper 🎉 emoji right at the start to mark the celebratory nature. The tone remains genuine – “impressed by your project – awesome job” gives credit to the user’s achievement. Ori immediately offers help for next steps (maintaining its role as a guide), but also gives a moment of recognition “I’m really proud of you. Onward! 🙌”. The use of “Onward” and the raised hands emoji 🙌 creates a feeling of shared victory and forward motion. This is high positivity while still feeling personal and not generic like “Congrats user #4545”.)_

6.  **Tweet-Length Introduction of Ori (for ambitious young professionals):**
    > “Meet Ori – your personal AI career guide ✨. Think wise mentor + smart scout in one. It analyzes the job market & your goals to continuously align your career with work that truly fulfills you. It’s like having a loyal compass for your professional journey. #NextBigThing” (247 characters)
    > _(This tweet (or LinkedIn post) is concise but packed with the value prop. Tone: upbeat and intriguing. It uses a sparkle emoji for attention and to hint at magic, clearly states what Ori is (“personal AI career guide”) and the benefit (align career with fulfilling work continuously). “Wise mentor + smart scout” gives a memorable framing. The final line “loyal compass for your journey” adds a poetic image. Hashtag #NextBigThing appeals to early adopters looking for cutting-edge. The voice remains confident but not boastful; it invites the audience to see Ori as something new and meaningful.)_

## 5. Visual System (Static Guidelines)

Ori’s visual identity should bring to life the brand’s ethos: “Serene, Whimsical, and Intuitive.” We aim for a mascot-centric system (like Duolingo’s Duo + logotype model) combined with a clean, modern interface. Every visual element should feel futuristic yet warm, blending space and nature motifs. Below are guidelines for designers and illustrators to craft Ori’s visual world:

### Mascot Direction: Ori the Firefly

- **Concept:** Ori’s mascot is envisioned as a futuristic, hyper-surreal firefly-inspired AI being. It embodies the idea of a tiny guide that illuminates the path in darkness. The mascot should instantly convey empathy, curiosity, and trustworthiness. Imagine if EVE from WALL-E (smooth, minimal, high-tech) had a baby cousin that was a bioluminescent firefly – that’s our Ori mascot.
- **Physical Traits & Silhouette:** Ori (the mascot) should have a simple, rounded silhouette with minimal extraneous details – a design that reads well even at small sizes. The body could be an orb or soft capsule shape (evoking EVE’s sleek form) with perhaps two little wing-like shapes or a subtle tail light to hint at the firefly nature. The mascot might not literally have insect legs or antennae (to avoid looking like a bug), but could have abstract indicators of a head vs. body (maybe a slightly larger top-half like a capsule head, and a tapering lower body with a glowing tail). The overall outline should be friendly (no sharp angles), something you could imagine hovering gently. Think “soft geometry”: circles, ovals, gentle curves.
- **Facial/Visual Cues:** Ori’s “face” can be very minimal – perhaps just digital eyes or a visor-like surface that can display simple expressions (akin to EVE’s blue LED eyes). The eyes or indicators can change shape or brightness to convey emotions (e.g., softly upturned curve for a smile, a gentle blink, a focused look, etc.). No mouth needed; emotion comes from eye shape and body language (like tilting or bobbing in animations). This keeps it futuristic and slightly abstract, but still endearing. The eyes should be kind-looking by default (maybe a soft blue or white glow).
- **Color, Glow & Materials:** The mascot should feel luminous. Its core color scheme should tie into the brand palette – likely a cool white or soft blue body with glowing accents of spectral blue and warm amber. One idea: Ori’s main body is a pearlescent white or silver (so it stands out on dark backgrounds), with an inner glow that can change color. The “firefly tail” part could glow gentle amber or golden when it’s emoting warmth or celebrating something, and perhaps cooler blue when thinking or idle. The glow should never be harsh; it’s a soft aura, like a halo of light. You might incorporate a subtle gradient or translucency to suggest it’s a being of light/energy, not a hard metal robot. In dark mode especially, Ori should look like a little friendly star floating on the screen.
- **Emotional Range & Expressions:** Ori (mascot) is mostly calm and positive. Its resting “face” should be neutral-friendly. It can express a handful of clear emotions for different states: e.g., happy/proud (eyes slightly arc like a smile, glow pulses gently), sympathetic/sad (eyes might angle up in the middle or dim slightly, body slumps a tiny bit), curious (tilts to one side, maybe one eye slightly bigger or a blinking animation). All expressions should be subtle – we avoid cartoonish exaggeration. Ori never frowns or scowls; at most it shows concern or reflective sadness with a dimmer light. Remember, Ori is an “innocent guide” — its emotional range is mostly various shades of encouragement, concern, and joy, not anger or frustration.
- **Mascot in Various Contexts:**
  - **App UI (Iconography):** In the app, Ori’s mascot might appear as a small assistant icon (for example, a chat head or a floating help button). At tiny sizes, we might simplify Ori to just a distinctive shape – perhaps just the glowing orb or the “head” with eyes. It should remain recognizable even at favicon size (16x16). Maybe the solution is to use the glowing firefly tail motif as the icon: e.g., a small circle with a glow or a spark, which users come to associate with Ori. This could double as a loading spinner (a little firefly light blinking) or notification dot.
  - **Hero Illustration (Marketing):** On the website or a poster, we can show a more detailed Ori mascot in an environment. For instance, Ori hovering next to a human figure who stands at a fork in the road (metaphorically), lighting up one path. The hero illustrations should use Ori as the guide presence – perhaps leaving a trail of light or hovering over a stylized landscape of stars or nodes (representing the network of opportunities). These scenes combine cosmic elements (night sky, constellations) with human elements (a person looking upward or walking forward). Ori can be slightly larger in illustrative style here or have more sparkles around it to draw attention, but it should remain somewhat small relative to the person – reinforcing it’s a guide by your side, not the center of attention.
  - **Empty States & Onboarding:** In empty states, Ori can appear with an inviting gesture (maybe a subtle wing wave or just floating with a gentle bounce). For example, if an onboarding step is “Tell us about your dream job”, Ori might appear holding an abstract “dream” symbol (like a small star or heart) to make the screen more engaging. The illustrations here should be lightweight (not too much detail) so as not to distract – possibly line art plus a bit of glow, featuring Ori next to some symbolic imagery (like a lantern, a telescope, a signpost, etc. depending on context). The key is Ori always appears as helpful, not overbearing. It might be off to the side or bottom of the illustration, leading the user’s eye to the content.

_(The mascot is central to brand recall, so consistency in how Ori is drawn is crucial. A style guide for the mascot should include example poses and do’s/don’ts – e.g., Ori should always face the user or direction of travel (not show its back), Ori should never appear with angry or silly expressions that undermine trust, etc. We are creating a character that users could genuinely get attached to, much like Duolingo’s owl, but in a gentler, more “guardian angel” kind of way.)_

### Logo & Wordmark Guidelines

Ori’s logo system will consist of a mascot logomark and a wordmark (the brand name in text). They should work in tandem but also independently.

- **Wordmark Design:** The wordmark is simply the name “Ori”. It should be set in a modern, clean typeface that reflects the product’s personality. Think minimalistic sans-serif – likely lowercase “ori” or a capital “O” with the rest lowercase, to give a friendly approachable vibe (all-caps might feel too loud for this brand). The letterforms should have soft, rounded touches rather than harsh geometric extremes, aligning with the humane tech feel. For example, a typeface similar to Google Sans, Avenir, or Circular could work – they have a contemporary feel with circular ‘O’ forms that echo the idea of completeness and cycles. Customization could include rounding some corners further or tweaking the “i”. Perhaps the dot on the “i” in Ori can subtly echo the mascot (e.g., the dot could be a small colored circle that represents the firefly glow). If appropriate, the dot on the “i” could even be abstracted as a little spark icon. The weight of the font should be medium – not too light (for readability at small sizes) and not too heavy (we want an elegant, not chunky, presence).
- **Logo Mark (Mascot Integration):** The mascot (Ori the firefly) itself can serve as the logo mark. We might have a simplified version of the mascot (like just the glowing orb with maybe two little wing stubs or the eyes) that can appear alongside the wordmark or standalone. A possible lockup is the mascot to the left of the text “Ori”. Spacing should be such that the mascot and text feel balanced (the mascot likely roughly the cap height of the text or slightly taller). When using color, the mascot will be in full color (with its glow effects) and the text likely in a single neutral or white. For black-and-white or small scale, we might use a solid icon version of the mascot (e.g., a simple firefly outline or a circle with two wing-like shapes).
- **Combination & Separation:** Ensure the logo works in these formats:
  1.  **Full lockup:** mascot + “Ori” wordmark for use in headers, splash screens, etc.
  2.  **Wordmark alone:** just “Ori” in text, e.g., for navbar when space is tight or in plain emails. This still should be recognizable given the distinct font treatment.
  3.  **Mascot alone:** for app favicon, social media avatar, or watermark. In those cases, the mascot icon should be distinct enough to carry brand recognition (which is why the silhouette and glow matter).
- The brand guidelines should specify clear space around the logo. E.g., keep at least the height of the “O” as padding on all sides when placing the full logo in a layout. The mascot’s glow should not be cut off or overlapped by other elements.
- Also consider a monochrome version: maybe the mascot can reduce to an outline or solid shape when needed (for printing in one color). The wordmark in monochrome would just be the chosen type.
- **Tone of Logo:** Overall, the logo (text + mascot) should feel calm and confident. There’s no complex graphic shape or tagline attached, just the name and the simple character. It should communicate: this is a friendly, high-tech guide. When a user sees the Ori logo on, say, a mobile app icon, it should intrigue them (glowing little creature) and reassure them (clean, professional wordmark) simultaneously.

### Color Palettes

Ori will have two full color modes – Dark Mode (primary experience) and Light Mode (secondary) – each with a carefully chosen palette. Across both, we maintain a sense of cosmic serenity with sparing use of vibrant “star” colors for accents. All colors should meet accessibility standards for contrast.

#### Dark Mode Palette: (Primary)

This is the default, where Ori’s aesthetic shines (literally) like a soft glow in the dark cosmos.

- **Background & Base Darks:** Instead of pure black, we use deep desaturated dark tones with a hint of color (evoking outer space). For example, a very dark navy `#0D1B2A` or a charcoal with blue undertone (`#121212` with slight blue hue). These dark backgrounds are easier on the eyes and feel richer than flat black. We can have a couple of levels: a true background (`#0D1B2A` as main page background) and a slightly lighter panel color for cards or modals (`#1B2635`, for instance), to create layering.
- **Primary Accent (Star Blue):** A bright, spectral blue that pops on the dark background. This could be akin to an electric blue or cyan-blue, e.g., `#3EDBF0` (aqua) or `#4F83F1` (a vibrant blue). It should feel like a piercing star or a blue flame – signifying insight and action. This is used for primary buttons, links, highlights of active states. Ensure it’s bright enough to have good contrast with dark base (and might often be used in its glowing form with a slight outer glow).
- **Secondary Accent (Aurora / Teal or Purple):** We might incorporate a secondary color that pairs well with the blue for gradients or additional visual interest. Possibilities: a teal leaning green-blue (`#80FFC2` for a neon teal) or a soft purple-indigo (`#9B5CFD` perhaps). The idea is a color that can appear in illustrations or gradient mixes to evoke the night sky variety (like a nebula’s hint of purple). This secondary should be used more sparingly than the primary blue.
- **Warm Accent (Amber/Red):** Inspired by the idea of warmth, life, guidance – we include a small dose of warm color. This could be an amber/gold (`#F9A72B`) or a soft red-orange (`#FF7E5A`). Its purpose: to highlight success states or friendly elements (maybe Ori’s “tail light” glow uses this, or success messages get a warm tint). It should be used carefully so as not to dominate – think of it as the warm lamp light in the dark. For example, maybe error messages might use a muted red derived from this (accessible red for dark mode), and success a greenish-amber. (We can derive a green as well, but likely our palette can treat amber as success to be a bit different from typical green, as long as contrast is fine.)
- **Neutrals:** We need a set of neutral grays for text and secondary UI. Likely a light gray (`#E0E0E0`) for body text on dark (for high contrast but not stark white), a medium gray (`#A0A0A0`) for secondary text or labels, and an icon boundary color perhaps. White (`#FFFFFF`) can be used for headings or when maximum contrast is needed (e.g., white text on blue button). Essentially: white or near-white for primary text, mid-gray for secondary text, and dark gray for borders or disabled elements (e.g., `#444444`).
- **Semantic Colors:**
  - **Success:** could be a gentle green-blue (to stay in theme) or the amber if we choose that to highlight positive (but ensure it’s not confused with warning; maybe a slightly more green tone like `#3EE8A0` for success, giving a fresh alive feel on dark).
  - **Warning:** could use the amber base (`#F9A72B`) in more saturation.
  - **Error:** should be a clear but not eye-searing red (`#FF5E5E` maybe, which on dark is vivid but readable).
  - **Info:** can default to the primary blue.
    These should all be tested for contrast against backgrounds. The blue likely covers info and general interactive, which is fine since Ori’s brand is that blue. The green (if used) should still visually fit (perhaps a teal-green that doesn’t clash with blue).
- **Gradients & Glow:** In dark mode, gradients featuring our accent colors can be used for special backgrounds or illustrations (e.g., a gradient of deep indigo to blue to teal to mimic a nebula). Also, using outer glows (semi-transparent blurs of accent colors) around elements like the mascot or certain buttons can reinforce the luminous theme. But use these effects deliberately – for key focus points, not everywhere.

Dark mode should evoke standing under a starry sky: mostly deep blue-black, with specks of light and gentle color appears like the Milky Way. It must always remain easy to read (hence lots of contrast for text) and not devolve into neon overload. Restraint is key – pops of color on a canvas of night.

#### Light Mode Palette: (Secondary)

The light mode provides an airy, day-time counterpart to Ori’s experience, while maintaining brand consistency.

- **Background & Base Lights:** Use off-whites or very light cool grays instead of pure white, to avoid eye strain and to hint at a “morning mist” rather than sterile white. For example, `#F5F7FA` could be a page background (a very light gray with maybe a tiny blue hue), and `#FFFFFF` can still be used for cards on a slightly tinted backdrop if needed (or vice versa, white main background and a very light gray card for depth). Key is keeping it calm, not blinding.
- **Primary Accent (Star Blue):** The same blue from dark mode (`#3EDBF0` or similar) will be used in light mode, but we have to ensure it has enough contrast against light bg for things like text or small elements. We may need to use a slightly darker variant of it for text on white (e.g., `#127D99` as a darkened version of that cyan). Or we outline icons in that color. Essentially, in light mode, the vibrant blue might appear a bit less neon due to contrast needs – but should visually appear as the same “family” of blue (maybe 1-2 shades deeper).
- **Secondary & Warm Accents:** Again, the teal or purple secondary can be used in graphics or as subtle fills, but should be adjusted for light mode (perhaps slightly less saturation or more contrast as needed). The warm amber can still be used for highlights (maybe as a small mark or icon color), but on white backgrounds it might need to be a bit richer to be legible (e.g., `#E57C2B` for amber on white). We should also define a distinct link or hover color – likely the primary blue is fine for links, with maybe an underline. Hover states could use a lighter tint or subtle background fill of blue at 10% opacity.
- **Text & Neutral:** Text in light mode will be mostly dark gray or near-black for readability. For instance, main body text `#2A2A2A` (a charcoal) instead of true black, to keep the soft feel. Headings could be black or very close to it (`#000` or `#111`). Secondary text can be mid-gray (`#6F6F6F`). Borders and divider lines might use a light gray (`#DADADA`). We still incorporate the brand colors in icons or emphasis text where appropriate, but most of the canvas in light mode is neutral and open.
- **Semantic Colors:**
  - **Success:** a green that is friendly (e.g., `#29B378`, mindful of contrast on light – that might need dark text on it, etc.).
  - **Warning:** an amber/yellow that is not too light to fade (maybe `#EBAE17`).
  - **Error:** a slightly deeper red for light bg (`#D94A4A`).
  - **Info:** the blue itself.
    These should align with or be direct conversions of the dark palette choices, just tweaked for context (for example, the same hex might work if we use dark text on it). Maintain consistent meaning of colors across modes to avoid confusion.
- **Overall Feel:** Light mode should feel airy, spacious, and calm – like a cloudy morning with a bit of colorful sunrise. We avoid stark contrasts (except where needed for text). We can use soft shadows for depth (e.g., a card might have a very subtle shadow to lift it, color `#000` with maybe 5% opacity blur for a gentle effect). Gradients on light might be used in illustrations, but likely the UI itself stays mostly flat colors (with maybe a header or hero having a pale gradient). If using a gradient background in a hero section on light, something like a pale blue to pale purple pastel gradient could be nice, but very low-key.

#### Palette Usage & Accessibility

Designers should stick to the core palette and avoid randomly picking new colors. If variety is needed, derive from these primaries (e.g., lighter tints, darker shades). Ensure sufficient contrast for text/icons: for instance, avoid placing our bright blue text on a white background unless the blue is darkened to meet AA contrast. Use the official dark and light theme values provided once they’re tested. In general, lean on the dark background with light text format (or vice versa) for any important copy so it’s highly legible. The colorful accents should complement, not impede readability (use them for buttons, highlights, small areas). Keep in mind color-blind accessibility – e.g., differentiate error (red) and success (green/amber) with icons or labels, not color alone. We want Ori to be as inclusive visually as it is in voice.

_(Tip: When presenting the palette, show swatches with their HEX codes and an example usage for each – e.g., background, primary button, link text, etc., so developers and future designers apply them consistently. Also provide an example of both modes side by side to illustrate consistency.)_

### Typography

A clear and characterful typography system will further express Ori’s brand. We want type that is modern (for tech cred), highly legible (for UI), yet with a human touch (not overly mechanical).

**Primary Typeface:** A geometric sans-serif for headlines and UI, complemented by a humanist typeface for body text. For example, we might use Circular or Google Sans (Product Sans) for headings – these fonts have clean round shapes (the “O” is a perfect circle, which echoes Ori’s orb motif) and a friendly vibe. They exude modernity and approachability. For body copy and dense text, a humanist sans like Inter, Roboto, or Helvetica Neue (or a similar open-source font) works well – these are designed for legibility at small sizes and have more neutral, warm proportions. The pairing ensures the look is neither too whimsical nor too formal.

All typography should be web-friendly and available for both web and mobile app (Google Fonts or similar for ease, if needed, or a licensed font built into the design system).

- **Headings:** Use the geometric sans at distinct weights for hierarchy. Perhaps H1 (hero or page titles) is Bold or Semi-Bold, with a comfortable letter spacing (geometric sans tend to look great in bold at large sizes). H2, H3 can be Medium weight. Emphasize sentence case (avoid all-caps for large headings to keep the calm tone, unless a particular design calls for it sparingly). The headings can have a bit of extra spacing (like 1.05x normal) to give an airy feel. Example: “Ori Guides You” as a section title in 36px, bold, nearly black (or white on dark). This stands out but with rounded letters, it won’t feel shouting.
- **Body Text:** For most paragraphs and descriptions, use the humanist sans (or if the chosen primary font is very legible, could use one font for all but with varying weights). Body text should be Regular weight, 16px or so for web default (adjust for device). It should be black on light mode, or white on dark mode, at high contrast for readability. The humanist typeface will have slightly softer curves and more variation in stroke, making reading longer text comfortable. We might also allow a serif font for any long-form articles or blog content if needed to differentiate content type – but the product UI itself likely won’t need a serif. If a serif is desired for an editorial touch, something like Georgia or Charter in small doses could work, but this is optional.
- **UI Text & Labels:** Many UI components (buttons, input placeholders, tooltips) will use the sans-serif as well. We should define sizes: e.g., Button text uppercase or Title Case in Medium weight, slightly smaller (14px maybe) but with good letter spacing for clarity. Form labels maybe small (12-14px) in Medium or Uppercase with a neutral color. Make sure even the small text has sufficient contrast (e.g., placeholder text in dark mode might be `#888888` which on `#121212` is just around the acceptable range, maybe lighten it a bit).
- **Special Typography:** If the brand wants to emphasize the tech angle for code or algorithm references, we can include a monospace font (like JetBrains Mono or Courier New for a classic choice) to use in moderation (e.g., in a graphic, or to style something Ori “writes” like pseudocode for your career plan – only if it fits a concept). But generally, monospace won’t be core to the brand voice since we’re focusing on human tone, not hardcore coding aesthetic.
- **Tone in Typography:** Use italics or bold sparingly for emphasis in copy – Ori’s voice doesn’t shout, so bold is used for maybe titles or key numbers, not for random emphasis. We might use italic to denote a thoughtful or hypothetical tone (as we did in samples with stars or “fulfillment”). Underlines only for actual links. Avoid aggressive ALL-CAPS except perhaps on small UI elements like button labels if design prefers (though Title Case or sentence case on buttons feels more aligned with Ori’s calmness, e.g., “Continue” vs “CONTINUE”).
- **Scale & Modularity:** The type scale should probably follow a modular scale for consistency (e.g., each heading size maybe 1.25x larger than the previous). Ensure line-heights are generous, especially in light mode (maybe 1.6 for body text) to enhance that spacious, calm feel. In dark mode, a slightly tighter line-height (1.5) might appear more cohesive given white text on black can halo a bit.

_(Design tip: Put together a typography style guide page: show H1 through H6, body text, captions, and an example of form text, to ensure consistency. Include examples of the type in use with the actual brand copy if possible, so the mood is clear. The chosen fonts should reflect the brand keywords – serene (so no harsh blocky font), intuitive (readable), whimsical (a touch of playfulness, maybe in the geometric O or in a nice ampersand etc.).)_

### Imagery & Illustration Style

Our imagery will mix cosmic wonder, natural warmth, and human relatability. We want to visualize the concept of “guiding light” and continuous growth without resorting to cliché stock photos of people shaking hands. The style will be primarily illustrative with abstract elements, possibly supplemented by very carefully chosen photographic textures for richness (e.g., a real night sky or soft bokeh lights, blended subtly – but illustrations lead the way).

**Key characteristics of Ori’s imagery style:**

- **People Depiction:** When showing humans or characters, opt for simplified, stylized figures rather than detailed realistic photographs. This could mean silhouettes or minimal line-and-shape illustrations of people. For inclusivity, if we illustrate a person, avoid specific facial details or skin tones that anchor to one ethnicity – use more universal representations (e.g., two-tone illustrative people, or people drawn as outlines with a galaxy inside them, etc.). Another approach: depict the idea of a person via their outline filled with a gradient or starfield. If at times stock photography is used (say for blog posts), it should be photos that feel candid, calm, and optimistic – and likely overlaid with a slight color tint or Ori’s gradient to maintain brand feel. But primarily, we anticipate using illustrations and possibly 3D rendered scenes for a futuristic touch.
- **Space + Nature Fusion:** Imagery should frequently include elements like stars, constellations, planets, or cosmic swirls combined with natural motifs like plants, mountains, or the glow of fireflies. For example, an illustration might show a silhouette of a person looking up at a constellation that subtly outlines a career ladder or a path – blending the idea of aspiration (stars) with guidance (constellation forming a shape). Another might show a tiny Ori firefly guiding a person through a dark forest, where the darkness is filled with gentle patterns of circuit-like constellations. The color palette for illustrations will use our brand colors: dark blues, purples, with pops of white and blue for stars, and warm amber for any natural light (like a lantern or the firefly).
- **Use of Glow and Light:** Embrace glow effects to create the feeling of bioluminescence and technology magic. Techniques could include: soft halos around Ori mascot, glowing particles in the background (like firefly lights or stars), gradient glows behind key text or UI elements for emphasis. However, keep glows soft and diffuse (no sharp neon glints that would feel harsh). Motion blur or glow streaks could imply movement of the mascot or progress in an illustration (e.g., a streak of light following a path to indicate travel). Glows can also highlight specific content sections (like a call-out quote might have a subtle background glow graphic).
- **Level of Realism:** Lean towards semi-abstract and symbolic rather than literal realism. That means we often illustrate concepts metaphorically. Example: to depict “continuous evolution of one’s professional identity,” an image might show a series of butterfly-like icons (but robotic or starry) emerging upward, or a person’s silhouette with layers peeling into new silhouettes, guided by Ori’s light. These are abstract representations of ideas. Photographic realism is not the goal; if photos are used, they will likely be overlaid or integrated into a design that also has illustration (mixed media style) to keep consistency. The overall impression should be somewhat dreamy and imaginative, yet clean – akin to looking at a thoughtfully designed sci-fi book cover or a calm animation still.
- **Illustration Style:** We can choose between a vector flat style with gradients (for a modern SaaS feel) or a subtle 3D style (using tools like Blender or Cinema4D to create soft, round 3D shapes for Ori and environment). A hybrid could work: perhaps Ori the mascot is a 3D render for extra smoothness and lighting, while backgrounds are flat vectors with gradient fills. If going pure vector, use smooth lines, generous curves, and avoid clutter. If going for 3D, keep materials matte or softly glowing – nothing too shiny or textured heavily. In either case, maintain a consistent stroke or shape language. Possibly incorporate circular motif (circles, orbits) since Ori is about cycles and guidance.
- **Gradients and Abstract Shapes:** Gradients should mimic natural phenomena like dusk skies or auroras: e.g., a gradient that goes from deep blue to teal to purple might serve as a background. Abstract shapes like swirling lines (to indicate connection or paths), dots (stars), and gentle curves (orbits, wave patterns) can be used as decorative elements. For instance, a background pattern on the website could be a faint array of dots and lines like a constellation map. Or on a slide, a corner might have a fade of color with a few sparkles. Consistency here is key – pick a motif (like constellations or glow orbits) and use it subtly across various materials.
- **Iconography:** Icons in the product should align with the illustration style – likely line icons or filled icons with rounded corners. They should use the same stroke width and style across the set. Prefer metaphoric icons when possible (e.g., a small spark icon for “insight”, a target icon for “goal”, etc.) to stay on theme. Use the primary accent colors for icons where color is needed, otherwise neutrals. Avoid overly detailed icon designs; keep them minimal and intuitive.
- **Imagery in Motion (for later, if animated):** While static guidelines are our focus, hint at how things could move. E.g., an animation of Ori flitting around leaving a trail of light, or stars slowly twinkling in a hero section. Static designs can imply these by showing multiple positions of a moving element in a single graphic (motion lines). When we do animate in product or marketing, the motion should be slow, easing, and calming (no hectic flashing).

In summary, Ori’s visual world should feel like stepping into a calm night illuminated by friendly starlight and the gentle pulse of fireflies – where high-tech data (constellations, networks) merges with the organic (nature, personal human journey). Every visual element, from the mascot to the color of a button, should reinforce that Ori is quietly powerful, empathetic, and a bit magical. Designers should be able to take these guidelines and create anything from a landing page illustration to a social media graphic and have it immediately recognizable as Ori.

_(Example prompt for hero illustration: “A young professional stands at a cosmic crossroads under a starry night sky. A small glowing robot-firefly (Ori) hovers beside them, casting a soft light on one path. The scene is minimalist, with silhouettes of mountains and a few plants at their feet, and constellations in the sky subtly forming shapes of different career icons.” This kind of imagery would capture the brand’s essence.)_

## 6. Product & UX/UI Guidance

Translating the brand into the product experience is crucial. Ori’s UX/UI should embody the brand personality — meaning using the visual elements and voice in a way that makes the app feel like interacting with that calm, whimsical, intuitive guide. Below we outline how the brand informs various aspects of product design:

### Layout & Navigation Personality

The overall layout should communicate clarity, calm, and guidance. We want users to feel oriented (no pun intended) and not overwhelmed when using Ori.

- **Homepage (Marketing Site):** The homepage should immediately convey spaciousness and focus. Use ample negative space, especially in dark mode with perhaps a starry subtle background. The hero section might have a headline, subheadline, CTA, and an illustration (Ori mascot guiding a user) – all centered and balanced. Use a grid system to align sections, but break the grid creatively with imagery (for a whimsical touch, maybe an illustration overlaps two sections slightly, or a diagonal shape divides sections mimicking a horizon). Each scroll section should have one key message and maybe an accompanying visual, rather than dense text. The color scheme here can showcase the dark cosmic palette with bright accent pops on CTAs (e.g., a spectral blue “Get Started” button on a dark hero). As the user scrolls, the guide (Ori) can appear in images or as a little motif pointing out things (“Ori tip: …” kind of elements in the design). Importantly, the homepage should not feel like a cookie-cutter SaaS template – our brand elements (mascot, gradients, stars) should give it a unique flavor that matches our ethos of guiding light and continuous growth.
- **Dashboard (Authenticated App):** Once in the app, the dashboard is like a home base for the user’s career journey. This should feel intuitive and personalized. Likely a two-column or card-based layout where Ori highlights the most important information first (e.g., one card might say “Your Progress this week” with a friendly summary, another “New Opportunities for You” listing a couple of roles, etc.). The navigation (perhaps a sidebar or top menu) should use clear icons+labels (e.g., Home, Jobs, Skills, Messages, Profile). Given our brand, using icons with rounded style and maybe the accent color for the active state is good. The vibe of the dashboard is calm – not a million blinking notifications. We use visual hierarchy (large headings and key stats) to draw attention rather than bright red badges everywhere. Ori’s mascot might appear in a small welcome message up top: e.g., a little Ori icon next to text “Good evening, [Name]. Ready for your next step?” This immediately personalizes the experience. The layout should adapt between dark and light modes gracefully (maybe user can choose mode or it’s by system default).
- **Overall Layout Considerations:** Keep a consistent spacing scale – padding and margins that give enough breathing room (e.g., 16px or 24px base grid). Use card surfaces or section backgrounds to group related content, but avoid heavy boxing of everything (which can feel cluttered). Instead, rely on spacing and subtle dividers or different background tones to separate sections. The navigation and header should be unobtrusive – perhaps a slim top bar with the Ori logo on left and maybe user avatar on right. In dark mode, that bar could be nearly black or translucent. In light mode, it could be white with a bottom border. The brand’s whimsical touches (like a tiny star icon as a bullet point or the firefly appearing next to a section title) can be sprinkled in, but should not disrupt functionality – always secondary to usability.

### UI Elements: Buttons, Cards, Inputs, Icons

All UI components should reflect Ori’s design principles: approachable (rounded where possible), high-contrast and accessible, and subtly lively (with small animations or interactive feedback that feel “alive”).

- **Buttons:** Use the primary accent color (electric blue or spectral blue) for primary action buttons. Buttons should have moderately rounded corners (e.g., 6px or even fully pill-shaped if that fits the style). The text on them should be clear (use the chosen font, Medium weight). For dark mode, a bright blue button with white text works, and on hover or focus, consider adding an outer glow or a slight pulse animation to reinforce the guiding light feel. In light mode, a filled blue button also works (with maybe a slightly darker hover), or one can use a ghost style (blue border, white fill) for secondary actions. Ensure button height is comfortable (not tiny) – since Ori is about guidance, we don’t want fiddly small tap targets. Maybe 44px height min, with extra padding for a friendly feel. The button label tone should be action-oriented but gentle (“View Details” or “Explore roles” vs. just “Submit”).
- **Cards/ Panels:** Use card layouts to encapsulate things like job suggestions, skill progress, etc. Cards can have a slight background color (in dark mode, maybe a slightly lighter dark `#1E2A38` panel on `#0D1B2A` background; in light mode, white panel on light gray background). Give them rounded corners (consistent with buttons, say 6px or 8px radius) to match the friendly aesthetic. Add a small drop shadow or elevation especially in light mode (very soft shadow) and perhaps a faint glow in dark mode (like a subtle neon edge) to make them distinct. Each card might have an icon or small graphic – ensure those icons use brand colors or illustrations that include Ori if appropriate (like Ori peeking on an empty-state card). Spacing inside cards should be generous (no wall of text). If listing items (like a list of jobs), separate them with subtle dividers or distinct sub-cards so it’s not overwhelming.
- **Inputs & Forms:** Input fields (text boxes, dropdowns) should be minimal and clean. Use rounded rectangle borders (again a small radius to tie together with buttons and cards). In dark mode, perhaps the input has a border or background of `#273544` (dark grey) and a slight inner glow on focus. In light mode, a white input with a solid border `#CCC` that turns to the blue accent on focus is good. Placeholder text, as mentioned in typography, should be in a friendly tone if needed (e.g., a search box could say “Search roles or skills…” rather than just “Search”). Include accessible labels or helper text that follows Ori’s voice (“Choose 3 skills you’d love to develop – this helps me tailor suggestions.” would be a nice helper line near a multiselect input). For interactive controls like sliders or toggle switches, incorporate the accent colors (a toggle switch might be a small pill toggle that glows blue when “on”, etc.).
- **Icons:** Icons throughout the UI should be consistent style – likely line icons with a slight round line cap, or simple filled icons. Use a stroke width that is legible (maybe 1.5px at 24px size for line icons). Common icons might include: a compass or map pin (for navigation or career path concept), a star (for favorites or something notable), a book or graduation cap (learning), a briefcase (job roles), a chat bubble (messages), etc. All icons should be derived from a common set or library and then tweaked to match Ori’s style (rounded corners, etc.). Use the brand’s primary colors appropriately: for instance, the active nav icon could be highlighted in the blue; notifications icon might use the amber for a dot, etc. But avoid a multicolor rainbow of icons in one screen – better to use mostly neutral or monochrome icons and just accent the ones needing attention. If an icon can incorporate a slight whimsical element, go for it (e.g., maybe the “opportunity” icon is a small shooting star rather than a generic bell). But clarity comes first – users should immediately recognize what an icon means.
- **Corner Radius Philosophy:** We’ve touched on corners: basically, nothing in Ori’s UI should have painfully sharp edges. The general radius in the design system might be ~8px for main components (buttons, cards), perhaps larger (16px) for very large surfaces like a modal window to really soften it. However, we also avoid going full “bubbly” unless it suits – balance soft with modern. The radius chosen should carry across consistently so the UI feels cohesive.
- **Shadows and Depth:** Ori’s design likely uses depth sparingly to keep it calm. In dark mode, traditional drop shadows don’t show much; instead, we might use glows or lighter panel colors for layering. In light mode, use subtle shadows to differentiate layers (like a floating card over background). The philosophy: shadows/glows are functional (to show hierarchy) but can also reinforce the brand (a glow = Ori’s guiding light metaphor). E.g., perhaps the currently highlighted section gets a very faint pulsing glow behind it to draw the eye. But be careful not to overdo animations (only for important states).
- **Motion / Micro-interactions:** (Integrating here although there is a separate motion section below, since it ties to elements.) Buttons might slightly animate on click – e.g., a quick subtle glow or a depress effect. Icons could have hover animations (maybe the star icon twinkles when hovered, etc.). These little touches make the UI feel alive and in tune with the mascot character.

### Motion Design: How Ori Appears & Interacts

Ori’s motion design should be gentle, meaningful, and delightful without being distracting. Think of Ori not just as graphics on a screen, but as something with behaviors.

- **Mascot Appearances:** Ori (the mascot) could appear contextually with simple animations. For example, when the app loads, instead of a generic spinner, you might see a tiny Ori firefly icon looping or fluttering softly – essentially a custom loading animation that doubles as branding. When Ori presents a tip or message (like in a tutorial overlay), the mascot icon could fade in with a slight upward float and glow, as if it “flew in” quietly. These movements should be slow-ish and easing (no bouncy rapid motions, which would feel too hyper for our serene vibe). Ori might also have an idle animation in certain screens – e.g., on a mostly static dashboard, a tiny Ori in the corner could blink or gently sway once in a long while, to give a sense of a living presence, but it should be very minimal so as not to steal focus.
- **General UI Transitions:** Transitions between pages or states (like moving from the dashboard to a detailed role view) should be smooth and calming. Perhaps use a fade-in/out combined with a slight slide. Avoid harsh instant changes or jarring effects. A nice touch: incorporate dissolve to black or dissolve through light transitions (mimicking eyes opening/closing) when appropriate. For instance, if there is a major mode switch, maybe the screen does a quick fade through a color (like a flash of blue or a brief dimming like a blink). Keep durations moderate (300ms to 500ms for most, maybe a tad longer for very significant transitions like finishing onboarding to first dashboard, to create a moment of “welcome”).
- **Hover and Feedback States:** For interactive elements, provide feedback that aligns with the theme. Hover on a card might subtly raise it (as if levitating) and add a slight glow at its edges. Clicking a button might produce a ripple or a quick glow that then fades. If using Material-like ripple, maybe make it a glow ripple rather than a harsh solid one. Focus states (for keyboard navigation) should be clearly indicated with outlines or glows in the accent color so accessibility is strong.
- **Micro-interactions with Meaning:** Use small animations to celebrate or acknowledge user actions. E.g., when a user marks a goal as achieved, you could trigger a tiny burst of star particles or a brief trail of light that moves upward – a visual “high five” from Ori. When a user completes onboarding, maybe Ori does a little loop-de-loop animation with a shine. Conversely, when something is loading or thinking, Ori might rotate slowly or a small orbit animation can show “I’m working on it” – better than just a spinner. All these should be optional subtle cues; nothing should trap the user or waste time, they should always be able to proceed.
- **Avoiding Distraction:** While we have these nice motions, remember many users will be using Ori seriously to plan careers – we must not annoy them. So animations should generally only play once at significant moments (not on every minor interaction repeatedly). Provide settings if needed to reduce motion for those who prefer it (honoring “prefers-reduced-motion” CSS for example). The key is to strike delight, not gimmick. Ori’s motions are like its way of speaking non-verbally: gentle nods, not frantic gestures.

### Empty States & Onboarding with Ori as Guide

We touched on empty states in copy and visuals, here’s a strategic take on them:

- **Empty States Philosophy:** An empty state (when a section has no data yet) is not just a blank – it’s an opportunity to a) reassure the user and b) guide them towards the next step. Ori’s mascot should often appear in these scenarios to personify that reassurance. The design of an empty state could feature a smaller illustration or icon of Ori plus a short message in Ori’s voice (see copy example). For consistency, possibly design a standard empty state component: e.g., an illustrated Ori sitting on a file cabinet for an empty “Saved jobs” list, or Ori holding a compass for an empty “Career plan”. Use the brand colors (some light background shape, plus the illustration). Keep it visually lightweight – not too many elements – to keep focus on what the user should do next. And always include a call-to-action or tip (“Use the search to add your first goal,” etc.).
- **Onboarding Flow:** The onboarding of Ori (first-run experience) should feel like meeting your guide. Instead of a dry form, consider a conversational onboarding: Ori might “ask” the user questions one by one (simulating a chat or interactive form, even if it’s just a multi-step form UI with the mascot icon next to each question). For example, step 1: “Hi, I’m Ori! To help you best, I’d love to know a bit about you. First, what’s a goal you have in your career?” with an input. Step 2: “Thanks! And which fields or industries excite you?” etc. The UI for this could show Ori’s mascot on one side of the screen, with speech bubbles or cards containing these questions, and answer fields below. This makes it feel less like “fill this form” and more like a friendly interview. Use progress indicators (like a series of dots or steps at the top) with possibly little playful labels (“Hello”, “Skills”, “Dreams”, “Finish”) to orient without stress.
- **Ori’s Presence in Guidance (not distraction):** We emphasize that Ori-as-mascot should help, not annoy like a certain infamous paperclip. To achieve this, make Ori’s interventions contextual and user-controlled. For instance, have a “Need help?” floating Ori icon that the user can click if they want guidance on the page. Or a subtle pulse on the Ori icon if it has something to say (and if user ignores it, it quiets down). In tutorials, allow skipping. Ori should never cover important content or pop up randomly with off-topic tips. One idea: a persistent but discrete “Ori bar” or sidebar section in the dashboard where Ori’s latest tip or question is. It’s part of the layout rather than an overlay, so the user can engage when ready.
- **Examples of Onboarding Visuals:** Possibly include a hero illustration on the sign-up screen: a user silhouette and Ori greeting them. Then use simpler illustrations or just the mascot head for subsequent steps. Each screen’s visuals and text should reinforce positivity (“We’re excited to have you”, “This info helps me help you”). At the end of onboarding, do a brief celebratory screen – Ori might appear with a slightly larger graphic saying “Welcome aboard, [Name]!” maybe with a tagline about moving forward. That moment should segue into the actual app with a smooth transition (perhaps Ori literally “guides” them by pointing to where to start).
- **Guided Tips in UI:** Once onboarded, Ori might occasionally highlight new features or sections with a one-time tooltip (with the mascot icon) that says e.g., “This is your Weekly Outlook – I’ll update it every Friday with new insights.” These should be few and well-timed (perhaps tied to triggers like first visit of a section or after a week of usage). They should also be easily dismissible. The visual style can be a small dark or light tooltip box with the Ori icon next to it and an arrow pointing to the element. This ensures continuity of the guiding persona even as user explores.

In essence, the product should feel like Ori-the-character is woven into it — not in an overbearing way, but as a helpful presence embedded in the UI and UX writing. By aligning layout, components, and interactive behavior with the brand’s calm and guiding ethos, we ensure users experience the brand values directly whenever they use Ori.

_(Design idea: The empty state illustrations and onboarding graphics can double as content for social or help docs, creating a coherent visual story. For example, the image of Ori guiding a person up a path used in onboarding can appear in a blog post about “finding your path”. This cross-use reinforces the brand consistently.)_

## 7. Social & Marketing System

Finally, extending Ori’s identity into social media and campaigns ensures that the brand is consistent and engaging wherever people encounter it. Ori’s marketing should feel like storytelling by a wise, friendly guide, not pushy advertising. Below are guidelines for content strategy, visual/tone consistency, and campaign ideas:

### Content Framework – Social Media Pillars

To build an audience and community, Ori’s social content can revolve around 3–5 recurring pillars or themes that reinforce its mission and personality. Here are proposed content pillars:

1.  **“Career Constellations” (Insights & Signals):** Educational, insight-driven posts where Ori shares real-time labor market intel, trends in careers, or emerging “stars” in the skills universe. For example, a weekly post highlighting a “Career Constellation of the Week” – a thread of roles connected by a new skill or trend (like AI ethics, remote work, green energy jobs, etc.). Tone: informative yet approachable. Could use infographics or short videos with data viz (e.g., a constellation graphic showing connections). This positions Ori as knowledgeable and on the cutting edge, supporting the RTB of real-time intelligence. It also gives value to the audience (they learn something useful). Hashtags might include `#CareerSignals`, `#FutureOfWork`.
2.  **“Ori’s Guidance” (Tips & Growth Hacks):** Bite-sized career advice and up-skilling tips, always in Ori’s empathetic voice. This can range from interview tips, resume tweaks, productivity or learning hacks, to mindset and wellness advice for professionals. The twist is that it’s always framed positively (no generic “10x hustle” vibes). For example: “Feeling burned out mid-week? Ori Reminder: Take 10 minutes to reflect on a recent win – big or small. It trains your brain to see progress, which fuels your motivation. 🌱” or “Skill Spotlight: Storytelling. Whether you’re a marketer or an engineer, being able to tell a story sets you apart. Try this: Next time you update your CV, frame each experience as a narrative of problem->solution->impact.” These posts reinforce Ori’s voice as a mentor and show its holistic approach (skills + well-being). Perhaps tag with `#OriGuidance` or `#WisdomWednesday` (if aligning with a day).
3.  **“Ori Stories” (User Journeys & Testimonials):** Narratives of individuals (early users or hypothetical personas) who found success or clarity with Ori’s help. This humanizes the brand. For instance, a short video or threaded story: “Meet Alex: He was a data analyst who felt stuck. Ori identified his creative streak and suggested UX design. Six months later, Alex is a UX Researcher blending data with design – and loving it. Here’s his journey 👉 …” These can be written as mini case studies with a before/after and how Ori intervened. Visually, could pair with illustrations (maybe an avatar plus Ori mascot guiding along a path graphic). It emphasizes the emotional benefit Ori provides and provides social proof. Use hashtags like `#OriStories`, `#CareerJourney`.
4.  **“Behind the Light” (Ori Development/Brand BTS):** Occasionally, content about the making of Ori – the team philosophy, the AI behind it, the brand ethos. This pillar appeals to early adopters who like to know the vision and people behind products. It might include founder quotes, glimpses of design sketches for the mascot, or how the matching algorithm was trained with empathy in mind. Posts here strengthen trust by showing transparency and passion behind Ori. For example: a post with a sketch of the mascot: “Fun fact: Ori’s look was inspired by fireflies – symbols of guidance in the dark. Our design team chose a soft glow and round shapes to make Ori feel calm and friendly. 🌟 #design”. Or a short intro of team members “Humans of Ori” style. Tone: a bit more personal and earnest. Hashtags: `#BehindOri`, `#StartupJourney`.
5.  **(Optional) “Purposeful Work Spotlights”:** Broader inspirational content about meaningful work. This could highlight interesting unconventional careers, interviews with people who forged unique paths, or upcoming fields that could fulfill the purpose-driven audience’s interest. Essentially aligning with the theme “purposeful work as a right, not a privilege.” E.g., an article summary like “The Rise of Climate Adaptation Specialists – purposeful roles that will shape our future (and how you can become one)”. Ori shares such content with a comment on why it matters. This positions Ori as forward-thinking and values-driven beyond just its product.

Each pillar should be visually branded: use the color palette, include the mascot or its elements where it fits (maybe Ori appears in an infographic pointing at data, or as a tiny footer character with a quote bubble in a tip post). Maintain a consistent style (same filters or illustration style for images, consistent typography for quote cards, etc.).

### Visual & Tone Consistency on Social

- **Visual Consistency:** Use our brand colors in social graphics – e.g., dark background with bright text or vice versa for an eye-catching contrast. Perhaps establish a template: for example, a circular motif (representing Ori or a planet) is present in all graphics; or a border that looks like a subtle glow. The mascot should appear frequently but not always the same pose (have a small library of Ori poses or emojis: Ori thinking, Ori celebrating, Ori pointing). If using photographs (like perhaps for a user story, showing the real person’s photo with permission), overlay a translucent dark blue filter or put star graphics around to tie back to Ori’s theme. Use the brand typefaces on any text overlays. In short, someone scrolling should start recognizing “this looks like an Ori post” from the colors and style even before reading.
- **Tone Consistency:** Keep the copy in social posts consistent with Ori’s voice, just adapted to the platform length and vibe. Twitter can be slightly punchier or use a bit more emoji as needed; LinkedIn might be more narrative and less emoji. But across the board, Ori is positive, empathetic, and insightful. Even when jumping on trends, do it in Ori’s style (e.g., a trending hashtag about careers – Ori contributes a thoughtful take, not a meme making fun of jobseekers). The “serene whimsy” can translate into occasional use of creative metaphors or gentle humor on social. For example, an Ori tweet might say: “Job hunting = like sailing 🌊. Ups and downs are normal; what matters is adjusting your sails. ⛵ Ori’s here as your lighthouse guiding you to safe harbor (a job you’ll love).” This is platform-friendly (short-ish, emoji-enhanced) but still on-brand message-wise.
- **Engagement Style:** Ori should interact on social like a personified brand. That means replying to comments or tweets in the same voice. If someone shares they landed a job with Ori’s help, Ori can reply “This makes my day – huge congratulations! Onward and upward 🚀” (keeping that calm enthusiasm). If someone asks a question, Ori answers helpfully, maybe even with a tiny tip. Also maintain professionalism: handle any criticism with diplomatic, caring tone (never defensive or snarky). The consistency in these interactions will strengthen trust and likability.
- **Accessibility & Inclusion in Social:** Use alt text for images describing illustrations, in an Ori-like tone (“Graphic: Ori (a tiny glowing guide) pointing at a bar chart of rising jobs in AI”). Ensure captions are clear even if someone can’t see the image. Avoid excessive emoji chains that screen readers struggle with – use them meaningfully as per voice guidelines. Also, be mindful of global audience: occasionally include diverse contexts (different industries, countries, etc., not always Silicon Valley examples).

### Launch Campaign & Narrative Ideas

When introducing Ori to the world, we want to emphasize it as a trusted companion in career journeys, not just another AI tool. The launch campaign should therefore be high on storytelling and user benefit, and low on empty tech hype.

**Launch Narrative Theme:** “A Light in Your Career Journey.”
This theme can be used in a multi-touch campaign showing how Ori is by your side in various scenarios.

Some concrete ideas and tactics:

- **Teaser Campaign:** In the weeks leading to launch, share cryptic but intriguing content around the problems Ori solves. For example, short video teasers: a dimly lit scene of a person late at night frustrated on job boards, then a small light (Ori) appears but we don’t fully reveal it – just the glow and relief on the person’s face. Tagline in teaser: “Finding your way is about to get easier. ️✨ #MeetOri”. These can run on socials and maybe targeted ads to our demographic. It creates curiosity by focusing on the emotional low (frustration) and hinting that something (a light) will help.
- **Story-Based Launch Video:** A 1-2 minute animated or live-action video for launch day: It could follow one person’s mini story (perhaps the persona from our elevator pitch) – they cycle through different stages (excited graduating, lost on LinkedIn, learning new skills, etc.), and at each stage Ori’s presence is shown as that subtle guiding light (like an orb that appears on their shoulder or lights up their map). The narration (or text overlays) would highlight Ori’s key value props emotionally: “When you’re unsure, Ori gives clarity. When you celebrate, Ori celebrates with you. When you grow, Ori guides. Not just an app – a companion for life’s work journey.” End with the full reveal of logo and call to action. The tone: heartfelt, cinematic, goosebumps-y but also comforting.
- **Interactive Launch Event (“Guide Me” campaign):** On launch week, encourage user engagement by asking people to share their career dreams or twists with a specific hashtag (`#MyOriPath` or `#GuidedByOri` perhaps). Ori’s team (or Ori’s account speaking in first person) can respond with a small piece of guidance or a positive affirmation tailored to some of them. Possibly even use AI to generate fun “constellation of skills” images for people who participate, as a gimmick (like, tweet your dream job and Ori replies with an image of a constellation connecting the skills needed). This positions Ori immediately as helpful and personalized rather than just broadcasting marketing.
- **Partnerships and Endorsements:** Introduce Ori via voices people trust in careers/self-development. For example, partner with a well-known career coach on LinkedIn to do a live stream where they “interview” Ori (someone from the team or an AI demo) about the future of work. Or have early beta users write blog posts/LinkedIn articles about their experience with Ori guiding them. Amplify these stories through Ori’s channels. The narrative: “This is not just another AI. It’s the guide we always wished we had. Look at how X used it to find direction.”
- **Campus or Community Launch (if applicable):** Since target includes well-off cities and maybe college grads, consider launch events at a couple of key universities or co-working spaces. The events could be “Career Stargazing Nights” where people come for a mini workshop on identifying their career constellation (with Ori being showcased). Use planetarium/star metaphors, give out swag like glow-in-dark stickers or small USB lights shaped like Ori. The idea is experiential – physically manifesting the brand ethos of guiding light. Share recaps on social to show momentum.
- **Trusted Companion Messaging:** In all materials, subtly contrast Ori with the impersonal tools. For example, one ad might say: “Job boards throw thousands of listings at you. Ori shines a light on the one that fits you.” Or “LinkedIn connects you with people; Ori connects you with your purpose.” These are bold statements, so ensure the tone isn’t negative, just distinguishing. Each such line can be paired with visuals of Ori vs. clutter (like Ori’s light highlighting one thing in a sea of many). This drives home why Ori is different. (We must be careful not to disparage others too hard, but a gentle juxtaposition is effective.)
- **User Advocacy Campaign:** Encourage new users to think of Ori in anthropomorphic terms by maybe a campaign like “#DearOri”: Users tweet or post questions like “#DearOri, I’m considering switching from marketing to UX but I’m scared it’s too late. What should I do?” and then Ori (via social manager or automated pipeline) replies with a helpful mini-answer. This public demonstration of Ori’s helpfulness will both produce content and show lurkers that Ori truly engages as a companion. It frames Ori almost like an advice columnist + friend. (Just ensure responses are thoughtful and on-brand; maybe prepare a Q&A bank or actually use our AI to craft answers with human review.)
- **Community Building:** Right from launch, emphasize that using Ori means joining a movement of people seeking meaningful work. Perhaps launch a community forum or Discord where users can share progress and Ori’s team can drop in tips. The brand in community should be the same voice, and the mascot can have a presence (maybe custom Ori emoji or stickers). The campaign could highlight this: “Ori isn’t just an app – it’s a community of bright minds navigating the future of work together.”

Throughout all these, measure success not just by signups, but by sentiment – are people commenting “I feel seen” or “This sounds like exactly what I need”? That’s a sign the brand story is resonating. If not, adjust messaging to emphasize empathy even more.

In conclusion, this brand identity guide for Ori provides a comprehensive blueprint: from high-level ethos down to UI details and social media tone. Ori should come across in every medium as that innocent guide and loyal mentor – combining deep intelligence with genuine empathy. By adhering to this guide, anyone working on Ori (designers, writers, developers, marketers) should be able to create output that feels unified and true to Ori’s spirit.

Ori’s brand is an evolving aura around the product – as the product grows and users interact, we’ll continuously refine the brand, just as Ori continuously aligns careers. But the core – Ori’s serene, whimsical, intuitive identity – will remain our north star, guiding all our creative decisions.
