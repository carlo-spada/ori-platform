# Task: Frontend - Plan Management (Upgrade/Downgrade)

## Objective
Implement the functionality for users to upgrade or downgrade their subscription plans on the billing page.

## Scope
*   In the "Plan Selection Section" (generated by `v0.dev`), connect the "Upgrade/Downgrade" buttons to the `/api/billing/change-plan` backend endpoint.
*   Implement a confirmation step before applying plan changes.
*   Handle the logic for different plan transitions (e.g., prorating, immediate vs. end-of-cycle changes).
*   Update the UI to reflect the new plan after a successful change.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Users can successfully initiate plan changes (upgrade/downgrade).
*   Plan changes are reflected in the UI and persisted via the backend API.
*   Confirmation prompts are displayed for plan changes.
*   Error handling is implemented for plan change failures.
*   New unit tests are added for plan change functionality.
