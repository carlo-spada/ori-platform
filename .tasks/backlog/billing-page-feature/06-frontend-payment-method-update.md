# Task: Frontend - Payment Method Update with Stripe Elements

## Objective
Integrate Stripe Elements into the billing page to allow users to securely update their payment method without leaving the application.

## Scope
*   In the "Payment Method Management Card" (generated by `v0.dev`), implement the "Update Payment Method" functionality.
*   Use the Stripe `Elements` provider (from `@stripe/react-stripe-js`) to wrap the payment form.
*   Call the backend's `/api/create-setup-intent` endpoint to get a `client_secret`.
*   Render a `PaymentElement` (or `CardElement`) from Stripe Elements.
*   Use `stripe.confirmSetup()` to confirm the new payment method.
*   Display the last 4 digits and expiration date of the newly updated card.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Users can click "Update Payment Method" to reveal a Stripe Elements form.
*   Payment details can be entered securely within the application.
*   The new payment method is successfully saved to Stripe via a Setup Intent.
*   The UI updates to show the details of the new payment method.
*   Error handling is implemented for payment method update failures.
*   New unit tests are added for Stripe Elements integration.
