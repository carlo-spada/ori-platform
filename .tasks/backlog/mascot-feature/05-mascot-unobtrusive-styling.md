# Task: Mascot Unobtrusive Styling Refinement

## Objective
Refine the overall styling of the mascot and its speech bubble to ensure it is visually appealing, unobtrusive, and aligns with the project's design principles.

## Scope
*   Review and adjust CSS for `src/components/mascot/Mascot.tsx` and its speech bubble.
*   Ensure appropriate `z-index` so it doesn't interfere with other UI elements.
*   Optimize size, opacity, and animation speed for unobtrusiveness.
*   Consider responsive design for different screen sizes.
*   Ensure the mascot's visual style (colors, shape, etc.) fits the overall Ori platform aesthetic.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The mascot and its speech bubble are visually harmonious with the rest of the application.
*   The mascot does not block critical UI elements or user interaction.
*   Animations are smooth and non-distracting.
*   The feature is responsive across various screen sizes.
*   No new visual regressions are introduced.
