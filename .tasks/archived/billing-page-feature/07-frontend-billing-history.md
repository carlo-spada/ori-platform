# Task: Frontend - Display Billing History

## Objective
Integrate the frontend billing page with the backend API to display the user's past invoices.

## Scope
*   In the "Billing History Section" (generated by `v0.dev`), use React Query to fetch data from the `/api/billing/invoices` endpoint.
*   Populate the table with actual invoice data (date, amount, status, and a link to the invoice PDF if available from Stripe).
*   Handle loading and error states gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The billing page displays a list of the user's past invoices.
*   Data is fetched from the backend API.
*   Loading indicators are shown during data fetching.
*   Error messages are displayed if data fetching fails.
*   New unit tests are added for billing history display.
