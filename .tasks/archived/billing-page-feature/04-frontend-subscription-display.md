# Task: Frontend - Display Current Subscription Status

## Objective
Integrate the frontend billing page with the backend API to display the user's current subscription status dynamically.

## Scope
*   In `src/app/app/settings/billing/page.tsx` (or a dedicated component), use React Query to fetch data from the `/api/billing/subscription` endpoint.
*   Populate the "Subscription Overview Card" (generated by `v0.dev`) with actual data (plan name, price, billing cycle, next billing date).
*   Handle loading and error states gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The billing page accurately displays the user's current subscription plan and details.
*   Data is fetched from the backend API.
*   Loading indicators are shown during data fetching.
*   Error messages are displayed if data fetching fails.
*   New unit tests are added for data fetching and display.
