# Project: AI-Powered Marketing System

**Objective:** Develop an internal AI system to handle marketing with minimal human intervention, aligning with our company's AI-first vision.

**Priority:** Strategic / Long-Term

**Phases:**

This project will be executed in multiple phases.

### Phase 1: Research and Prototyping

**Objective:** To validate the feasibility of an AI-powered marketing system and to build a simple prototype.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Research:**
    *   Investigate existing AI-powered marketing tools and technologies.
    *   Identify data sources for market trend analysis (e.g., social media APIs, news APIs, industry reports).
    *   Explore large language models (LLMs) for content generation.

2.  **Scaffolding:**
    *   Create a new microservice in the monorepo: `services/marketing-ai/`.
    *   Set up a basic FastAPI application.
    *   Define the initial data models and API endpoints.

3.  **Prototype Development:**
    *   Build a simple data ingestion pipeline to collect market data.
    *   Implement a basic content generation module using an LLM.
    *   Develop a simple dashboard to display market trends and generated content.

**Success Criteria for Phase 1:**

*   A research report summarizing the findings.
*   A functional prototype that can:
    *   Ingest data from at least one source.
    *   Generate a simple piece of content (e.g., a tweet or a short blog post).
    *   Display the generated content on a basic dashboard.
