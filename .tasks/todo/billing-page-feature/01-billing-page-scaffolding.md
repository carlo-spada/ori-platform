# Task: Billing Page Scaffolding

## Objective
Create the basic page structure and navigation entry for the new billing management page within the application settings.

## Scope
*   Create a new Next.js page file (e.g., `src/app/app/settings/billing/page.tsx`).
*   Add a basic layout for the page, including a title (e.g., "Billing & Subscriptions").
*   Integrate this page into the existing application navigation (e.g., add a link in the settings sidebar or main navigation if applicable).
*   Ensure the page is accessible only to authenticated users.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A new page at `/app/settings/billing` exists and is accessible.
*   The page displays a title indicating it's the billing management section.
*   A navigation link to this page is present and functional.
*   Only authenticated users can access the page.
*   New unit tests are added for page rendering and authentication guard.
