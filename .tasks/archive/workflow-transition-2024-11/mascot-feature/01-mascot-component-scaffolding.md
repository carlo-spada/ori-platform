# Task: Mascot Component Scaffolding

## Objective
Create the foundational React component for the mascot, including its basic visual representation and initial placement.

## Scope
*   Create a new React component file (e.g., `src/components/mascot/Mascot.tsx`).
*   Define a simple visual representation for the mascot (e.g., a placeholder SVG or a simple div with a background color/image).
*   Implement basic styling to make it a fixed-position element on the screen (e.g., bottom-right corner).
*   Ensure it's rendered within the main application layout (e.g., `src/app/layout.tsx` or `src/app/providers.tsx`).

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A new `Mascot.tsx` component exists.
*   The mascot is visible on the page as a fixed element.
*   The component is integrated into the application's main layout.
*   No console errors related to the new component.
*   New unit tests are added for the component's basic rendering.
