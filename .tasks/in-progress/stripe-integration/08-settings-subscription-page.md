# Task: Settings - Subscription Management Page Scaffolding

## Objective
Create a new sub-page within the application settings for users to manage their subscription.

## Scope
*   Create a new Next.js page file (e.g., `src/app/app/settings/subscription/page.tsx`).
*   Add a basic layout for the page, including a title (e.g., "Manage Subscription").
*   Integrate this page into the existing settings navigation (e.g., add a link in the settings sidebar).
*   Ensure the page is accessible only to authenticated users.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A new page at `/app/settings/subscription` exists and is accessible.
*   The page displays a title indicating it's the subscription management section.
*   A navigation link to this page is present in the settings.
*   Only authenticated users can access the page.
*   New unit tests are added for page rendering and authentication guard.
